A game called Multi Client Hand Cricket game is built using socket programming. It’s a two-player game where two players show scores on their respective fingers. If  the scores are equal, the batsman is declared out. Else, the score of the batsman is  added to the total runs of the batting team. For our project it’s a player vs pc game  where pc have a random choice generator such that pc doesn’t make a pattern from  its choices and keep the player in the game. We have also used multithreading such  that multiple players can play their respective games simultaneously.The  gane  also worrks using half duplex mode communication. The game is  made using TCP/IP protocol and half duplex server-client communication and can  be run in any computer device that has an IDE that can compile a python code.
